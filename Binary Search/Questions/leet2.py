# Given an array nums sorted in non-decreasing order. (The next number in the array is greater or equal to the previous) [-4,-4,-3,-3,0,1,2,2]
# Return the maximum between the number of positive integers and the number of negative integers.
# In other words, if the number of positive integers in nums is pos and the number of negative integers is neg, 
# then return the maximum of pos and neg.

# 1. State the statement problem cleary. Give exmaples of inputs and outputs
    # - Transverse through an array () arranged in a non-decreasing order. Count all the negative numbers(neg) and positive numebrs (pos).
    # - Compare then the count of pos and neg and return the largest number

    # Inputs :
    # nums = [-4,-4,-3,-3,0,1,2,2]

    # Output : (pos = 3, neg = 4) note: 0 is neither positive or negative = 4
