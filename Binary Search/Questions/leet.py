#LeetCode Question

# Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target.
# write a function to search target in nums. 
# If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity. (Divide And Concour : Binary Search)

#Constraints
# 1 <= nums.length <= 104
# -10^4 < nums[i], target < 104
#All the integers in nums are unique.
#nums is sorted in ascending order.
